# Neural Machine Translation using Recurrent Neural Networks

## Overview

This project implements a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system to translate text from French to English using a sequence-to-sequence architecture with GRUs (Gated Recurrent Units). The model is trained on parallel text data obtained from the translation site [Tatoeba](https://tatoeba.org/).
